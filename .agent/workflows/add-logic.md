description: Add dynamic React state logic or calculations to existing UI.
---

When I type /add-logic, implement requested dynamic logic.

Rules:
- Use React hooks (useState, useEffect).
- Keep logic simple and readable.
- Do not redesign UI unless necessary.
- Only output logic-related code additions.
