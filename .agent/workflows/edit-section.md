description: Edit or redesign a specific UI section without touching rest of the project.
---

When I type /edit-section, only modify the specific UI section I describe.

Rules:
- Do NOT regenerate the entire project.
- Keep existing design style consistent.
- Preserve existing color scheme and layout patterns.
- Output only the updated component code.
